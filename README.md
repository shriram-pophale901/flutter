I'm excited to share a major upgrade to my Flutter To-Do application, now rebuilt with a focus on clean architecture, robust data handling, and a polished user experience. This project was an excellent opportunity to put core mobile development principles into practice, from UI design to local data persistence.

Key Enhancements:

Modern UI for Task Creation: Implemented a sleek Bottom Sheet form for quick and intuitive task entry.

Robust Local Data Persistence: Leveraged the Sqflite package to reliably store, retrieve, and manage all user tasks directly on the device.

Structured Data with Model Classes: Developed a dedicated Task model to ensure clean, organized, and scalable data handling throughout the application.

Enhanced User Experience: Refined the overall UI to create a smoother and more efficient task management workflow.

This project was a fantastic learning experience in integrating a user-friendly front-end with a persistent back-end, showcasing my skills in UI/UX, data modeling, and state management.

A special thanks to my mentors for their invaluable guidance: Shashi Bagal, Akshay Jagtap, Rahul Hatkar, Prajwal Kadam, and Vedant Mahajan, and to Core2web Incubators for their support.
